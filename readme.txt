Instrucitons for building and launching app locally.

1. Copy files to a suitable directory. Navigate to that directory via the command line.
2. Create a new virtual environment with the command "python3 -m venv {env}" where {env} is the name or your virtual environment.
3. Activate the virtual environment by using the command "source {env}/bin/activate".
4. Upgrade pip by using the command "pip install --upgrade pip".
5. Install dependencies by using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
6. Launch the app by using the command "python3 index.py"
7. By default the app will launch to 127.0.0.1:8050, so you can open a web browser and view it locally at that URL.


Web app is hosted at Heroku to view. It is slow, but free. Please be patient.
